Future Development
Add more features and functionality to make the site more dynamic and multiple pages for each designated section of content.
Bring in an API to alert where certain establishments are on a walking map (Iphone - yelp map feature is the idea).
Ability to click to brewery site and read reviews as well as have options to start driving or walking directions to the desired destination.
Adding more space for advertisement as the site gains traction, sections for community sponsored events, local live music upcoming events, etc. make ad revenue eventually on the site as we build the brand and gain influence.
Create social media “share” buttons to allow users to share their reviews and interactions with our site to their personal social media platforms.
